  At Medium, our design teamâ€™s tool of choice is Figma<br>
  We use it practically every day,<br>
  <strong>but still get a bit of <u>joy</u> whenever we discover a small,<br></strong>
  lesser-known feature or tip.<br>
</p>

  <p>What if we didn't have no pop
  If the popsong writers just gave up
  Popsong supplyment would stop
  That would be something
  And the popsong singer might just say
  "I won't sing if I'm not paid
  At least not if I won't get laid
  Just give me something"
  And the popsong label A&R
  Just don't know how it got this far
  "I had to sell my Jaguar</p>
  <img src="spider-man.jpg" width="100%">

  <p style="margin-top : 100PX">
  Just to get something"
  And the record store guy had to close
  Or start selling pop-related clothes
  Or even get a job, who knows
  He'll sure find something
  And the popsong critic, who for long
  Has pointed out what's right and wrong
  Might start to listen to the song
  He could learn something
  And the popsong fan might just start
  To notice music from the heart
  Instead of looking at the chart
  That would be something</p>
